# Instructions for AI Agents

- **Do not edit anything inside `generated-server/`.** It is generated by running `./generate.sh` from `openapi.json`.
- When the API contract changes, modify `openapi.json` and regenerate the stubs rather than editing them by hand.
- Implement application logic in the `server/` directory which imports the generated stubs as a library.
- Follow the spec-driven development workflow described in `README.md`.
- Run `stack build` in `server/` when possible to verify changes.

# Yesod OpenAPI Experiment

This repository is an experiment in **spec‑driven development** for Yesod.
The OpenAPI specification is the single source of truth. Code is generated from
the spec and used as a library of stubs by the real application.

The goal mirrors the Swift tutorial in
[apple/swift-openapi-generator](https://swiftpackageindex.com/apple/swift-openapi-generator/1.7.2/documentation/swift-openapi-generator/practicing-spec-driven-api-development):
define the API contract first, generate boilerplate, then implement the logic
in a separate project that imports that boilerplate.

## Files

- `openapi.json` – Minimal "Hello World" OpenAPI 3 specification exposing a single `/hello` endpoint.
- `generate.sh` – Script that invokes `openapi-generator-cli` to produce the Yesod stub code in `generated-server/`.
- `generated-server/` – Code generated by OpenAPI Generator. It can be regenerated at any time and is treated as a library of stubs.
- `server/` – Hand written Yesod project that depends on `generated-server` and implements the real handlers.

## Workflow

1. Edit **openapi.json** to describe the API contract.
2. Run `./generate.sh` to regenerate stubs in `generated-server/`. This folder is
   never edited by hand and can be deleted and recreated at any time.
3. Implement the real handlers inside `server/` by importing the generated
   library. The production server replaces the `notImplemented` placeholders with
   working logic.
4. Repeat from step&nbsp;1 whenever the API changes.

## Usage

1. Ensure `openapi-generator-cli` is installed and available on your `PATH`.
   You can install it via Homebrew (`brew install openapi-generator`) or
   download the JAR from the OpenAPI Generator releases.
   Alternatively you can use the provided Docker command inside `generate.sh`.

2. Run the generator script:

   ```bash
   ./generate.sh
   ```

   The generated stubs will be placed in `generated-server/`.

3. Build the production server inside `server/` using `stack` or `cabal`. The `stack.yaml` in that folder references the generated package as a local dependency.
